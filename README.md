# single_cell reveal root cell ype specific genes for nitrate response

This repository is to confirm the root cell type specific genes in maize from published data :- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2022.02.004
Li, Xuhui, et al. "Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the landscape of maize root tips and assists in identification of cell type-specific nitrate-response genes.")

This study provides a global view of maize root tip developmental processes and responses to nitrate at single cell level.
In this publication they profiled transcriptomes of >7000 cells derived from root tips of maize seedlings grown on media with or without nitrate. 
Identified 11 cell types/tissues. Identified 85 cell type specific nitrate response genes including several known nitrate metabolic genes.

To assess the robustness of ScRNA-seq and the effect of protoplasting, conventional bulked RBA-seq was performed on root tips without protoplasting, and strong correlations between the ScRNA-seq psudo-bulked expression data and bulked RNA-seq expression data  (Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient = 0.8529 for nitrate+ and 0.8500 for nitrate-) 

In addition they conducted inter species comparison of root cells between maize and rice reveled the conservation and divergence of the root cell types
